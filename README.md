Organization “Silara Retail”  is inviting the Developers and Data Scientists to build a high performing recommendation engine for their online retail portal.

They are making their last one year customer transaction (anonymized) data available. For the customers in test data, the participants need to recommend the next items that they are most likely to buy.

You are expected to build a high performing recommendation engine using any framework of your choice. You are encouraged to use IBM Watson Studio Apache spark based Jupyter notebook.

The model created should be readily consumable by the organization and hence you are expected to expose the model as API endpoint using any toolkit of their choice. It will be good to consider using Watson Machine Learning (WML) available through IBM Cloud.

Tools used : 
Python
Implicit Feedback System
ALS
